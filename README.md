ESP-IDF template app
====================

This is an application to be used with [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

Please check [ESP-IDF docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for getting started instructions.

Thank to Mr. Neil Kolban for his unvaluable work and engagement in sharing knowledge.
I have not only learnt from his material and posts about programming the ESP-IDF framework using C++ language, but I have also included his cpp_utils in this project.
The cpp_utils can be found under the esp32 code snippet provided by him at https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets.

Thank also to tmrh20 for the famous RF24 library fork for using nRF24L01 chip.

The aim of this reporsitory is to provide a complete functioning project for transmitting data using nRF24L01.
